# General Notes
## Map Description:
Dear traveler, with no name or story, are you ready to embark for one last journey? Travel alone to Ghedagot – the fabled city at the end of the world, and uncover what dark things lurk beneath its ruined, crumbling skin. Prepare well, for it’s a long journey, longer than eons.

 
# Lore overview
The map takes place in an old, highly secluded region of the world, ruined and crumbled beyond belief. At this point, there is nearly nothing of value left here, only ruins. 

A long time ago, a group of scholars traversed this land and found the Citadel at the “edge of the world”. It was highly unusual, since there were absolutely no signs of civilization here. The Citadel was empty and dead, except for the unfading fire at the very top and several golden oak trees in its garden. It also was decorated with unknown pale material (Prismarine). Those scholars constructed a small settlement nearby, on the banks of the only river in the region – Geheel. Later this settlement grew, high walls were constructed and a name given – Ghedagot. Those exiled from Ghedagot or those who ran from it later retold its stories, and eventually it became almost a folklore tale. In such retelling it acquired fantastic qualities utterly distant from bleak reality.

First headmaster of the scholars died shortly after construction of the settlement. His successor, Auberon, took up the mantle. In his lifetime, Ghedagot experienced its rise and the start of its decay. He researched the unfading fire of the Citadel, which laid in its highest tower. That research gave him the insight that was necessary to build the Apogee, the main purpose of which was to allow for a crossing into the distant planes. Apogee was built on grounds stained with prismarine, as it was found that those were the parts of the world that were the closest to cosmos and easiest to make the crossings from.

And so, the crossing into the Nameless Lands was made. Upon seeing another unfading fire amidst cold wasteland, Auberon had his epiphany: “We must seek older fires, and for that we must dig deeper.” Ghedagot was named in honor of this epiphany, in honor of the second unfading fire. 

Afterwards, the secret of the Citadel was discovered. Previous crossings did not make use of the sky, yet to dive deeper into the human depths, a communion with cosmos was required. Citadel, being a thing from previous eons miraculously not crushed under the weight of the new world. Auberon made such a communion and created a crossing into the darkest depths, reaching previous world planes. 

Those planes are previous cycles of the world that ran out of power to continue their lives, and were eventually crushed and mostly perished as to make room for the new planes. Going deeper and deeper puts incomprehensible amounts of pressure onto the diver’s mind. As such, most go mad, crushed just like the planes they explore. Auberon went further than anyone else, finding new and new unfading fires. He returned irreversibly damaged, yet ascended. Having learned of those planes and touched their whole histories, he himself burned away, leaving an unfading flame.

Before perishing, Auberon ordered to cease the research at once. Having learned the terrible truth he wanted to preserve it a secret. Nevertheless, his mind never quite conquered the thought of going even deeper, and thusly he planned a way to do so. That required refashioning of the Apogee, which now was a place to melt and fuse the different unfading fires together. Together, those would become an entity capable of protecting one’s mind.

Yet after such a crossing, damage was irreversible for the world as well. Terrible things began creeping from the citadel, be it small human-like things or giant blightworms. Terrified, Ghedagot’s residents abandoned the city and the Citadel, fleeing as far away as they could. 
 
# Lore items

**V Old Sea’s Lagoon**
_(The Old Sea)_
The region is ruined and crumbled beyond belief, awaiting only the inevitable reduction to dust. Why would anyone care to visit these cold ashes?

**Common Medicine**
*(The Old Sea)*
Automatically cures hunger if held in inventory.

There's difficulty in preserving food on board, which inevitably leads to unsightly diseases. These herbal pellets mask symptoms and make them palatable, but only that.

**V Unfading Candle** 
*(The Old Sea – First Key room)*
Have a chance to not consume a torch while placing it.

Understanding the unfading fire was not required to put it to use. This primitive tool was just an example of what could be done with the discovery.

**V Golden Oak Leaf** 
*(Northern Watchtower – locked room)*
Grants an absorption shield every minute.

A single leaf said to have been taken from a fabled golden oak. It seems to, ever so slightly, radiate light. Or, perhaps, this is just one’s mind playing tricks?

**V Old Sea’s Shore**
*(Northern Watchtower)*
A group of scholars once found the great citadel at the edge of the world, its highest tower lit ever so faintly by the undying flame.

**V Golden Apple**
*(Northern Watchtower)*
Marvelous fruit that never spoils. It is said that the only place where they grow is somewhere near Ghedagot, the ill-fated city of spires. 

**V Valuable Book** 
*(Northern Watchtower)*
Due to the hectic nature of scholars’ escape, a fair amount of valuables were left behind. What has not yet decayed to dust will certainly prove to be useful.

**V Infantry Bow** 
*(Mouth of Geheel)*
This colossal construction wasn’t meant for war, but that does not mean it wasn’t prudent to put at least some defenses around it.

**V Rusted Key**
*(Mouth of Geheel)*
Opens the old tower’s basement, where the Candlemaker locked himself long ago in desperation. Did madness take the poor old man, or perhaps something else?

**V Paddle**
*(Mouth of Geheel)*
Geheel is the only river in this region. The first scholars built a small settlement near one of its branches. It later became well-known as the “great city of spires”.

**V Prismarine Pebbles**
*(Dig Site)*
These rocks seem almost alive, breathing ever so slightly.   To find them in nature is an exhilarating omen to those tinkering with the very fabric of the world. 

**V A Portrait**
*(Dig Site)*
Scholar’s first headmaster did not achieve much, and was quickly forgotten. His successor, however, left an unfading stain on this world.

**V Regular Torch**
*(Geheel’s Branch)*
The unfading flame of the Citadel puzzled scholars for years, and remained the last of its mysteries. In the end, they found the answer, but many wished they never did.

**V The Drowners**
*(Geheel’s Branch)*
When other methods fail, one must resort back to a cruder way of thinking. It’s of course known, that the dead tell no tales.

**V Purple Flower** 
*(Old  Santcuary)*
Headmaster Auberon led scholars with wise words and stern will. But in the end, that was not enough to overcome the terrible fate. Resigned to the impending doom, they faded away, leaving behind yet another heap of ruins.

**V Pearl from Cosmos** 
*(Old Sanctuary – first secret room)*
Cosmos and earth are linked inexplicably. Only through a communion with the stars above may men delve deeper into the crumbled ruins of their own creation.

**V Incense Lantern** 
*(Plagued Carcass)*
Increases movement speed at a cost of reducing health.

Substance within burns faintly, releasing a sweet haze, which dulls the brain to burdens of weight. Yet one must remain wary, for this transient feeling of levity is but a clever deceit.

**Apogee’s Foundation** 
*(Apogee, entrance inside)*
Despite the toll of time, Apogee repels all manners of hideous beasts. There is no reason to light up its ruinous floors and walls, for it is already safe.

**V  Unfinished Calculations** 
*(Apogee, near Outer Voids)\**
Places vastly scattered in different ages and different lands can be linked together. Before its refashioning, Apogee served to do precisely that. Even now, given the right tools, it can be used to visit places infinitely faraway. 

**V  Radiant Incense**
Said to be of the same origin as the Beacon fuel. While far less powerful, this incense is still effective at warding off monsters.

**V Note about Incense Burners**
Should the area near the Apogee be infested by monsters, one should seek to relight three Incense burners to ward off the beasts. Nearest one is in the graveyard to the east.

**Celestial Map (Plagued Carcass)**
There were, and are, things far beyond, in the vast planes of cosmos. Men willing to make contact are rewarded with cold disappointment. The bright ones, however, understand what the frigid failures are trying to tell them.

**Organic mush (Plagued Carcass)**
Sudden realizations upon contacting the Truth are dangerous for the brain. Those not possessing a naturally potent mind must seek other ways of protecting themselves.

**V Southern Knight’s Sword** 
*(Titanvale)*
In times past, knights came to this land in search of glory and fame. Even in death, they all stayed here, held by a force of strange, ethereal nature.

**V Bardiche**
*(Titanvale)*
This unusual weapon was adored in the times of war. Its large, sweeping strikes are extremely effective against crowds of enemies. 

**Ghedagot Key**
*(Garden of Hanging Stars)*
Opens the small passage in Ghedagot’s Wall.

Gates of Ghedagot were sealed shut to prevent anyone from wandering their way into the plagued city. The entrance near the aqueduct, however, was only locked.

**V Spiked Shield** 
*(Garden of Hanging Stars)*
A bardiche knight came to this region and fought his way through the Sanctuary. Yet, wounded and tired, he succumbed to his wounds shortly after climbing the Apogee.

**V Old Man’s Bow** 
*(Ghedagot – old man’s garden tower)*
Ghedagot was never in need of deliberate defenses. Utter isolation, treacherous terrain and titanic walls were more than enough.

**V Chronicles of Ghedagot – Tome II** 
*(Ghedagot – hole before last shortcut)*
Settlement’s architecture took heavily from the Citadel and certain visions of an even older age. While Ghedagot lacked the exquisite prismarine decorations, it was nonetheless awe-inspiring. 

**Waterproof Boots** 
*(Ghedagot – near aqueduct)*
In the times before endless dust storms, Ghedagot endured countless rains and thunders. And as such, its residents crafted garment specifically repellent from water.

**Worker’s Garb**
*(Ghedagot – aqueduct)*
Once the dust came, water became a precious resource. Previously reliant on rains, citizens of Ghedagot had to construct a large aqueduct, which would bring them water from the mountains.

**V Chronicles of Ghedagot – Tome IV**
*(Ghedagot – library)*
For years, Ghedagot had no name. But at once, headmaster named it in honor of some poor old man from a frigid land endlessly far away.

**Library Key**
*(Ghedagot - ?)*
While not quite as vast as Citadel’s Archives, the Library of Ghedagot holds a prodigious amount of knowledge, and some things of an even greater potency.

**V Deformed Prismarine** 
*(Ghedagot – library cellar)*
All enemies nearby are weakened and slowed, but you take more damage.

Even things that came from cosmos can be disfigured by it. This warm, gestating rock pulses sporadically. What could be squirming inside its seemingly dead shell?

**V - [E] Cleanser**
*(Ghedagot)* – using unluck Amp10
Sets monsters ablaze.

A simple concoction from the Citadel. Initially used to get rid of abominations brought from beyond, it later became a mean of self-defense.

**V Page from Ghedagot’s Chronicles** 
*(Blightworm Plantation – near Ghedagot shortcut)*
Although called so, Ghedagot was never the true “city of spires”. Even more, it hardly could be called a city. The misnaming came from settlement’s descendants, who turned what little they knew of it into fantastic tales.

**V Egg of a Blightworm** 
*(Blightworm Plantation - start)*
Gargantuan worms of insatiable hunger laid waste to Ghedagot’s plantation. In the end, their glutton became their demise, and Geheel became their grave.

**V Blightworm Meat** 
*(Blightworm Plantation - end)* 
All blightworms were drowned in Geheel’s putrid waters, and now only their eggs litter its bottom. Years of decay made sure there is nothing of value to be found there.

**Ancient Gravel**
*(Catacombs – first chest)*
Catacombs originated even before Ghedagot. Decades upon decades of undisturbed decay infused its walls and floors with unparalleled fragility.

**V [E] Beast’s Antler/Shoulder Blade**
*(Catacombs)*
Unnaturally twisted bone, distantly resembling a pickaxe/axe.

(1)
Originated from a blind crystallized abomination. Having lived in ages long gone, it had a stench of distant cosmos. Masterful incision revealed miraculous bones tougher than steel. 

(2)
Having made a communion with the stars, the abomination feared perishing more than anything, and so developed unbreakable bones that would support its carcass forever.

**Summer Pilgrim’s Sword**
*(Catacombs – final room)*
Sword of the nameless traveller who once visited Ghedagot.

Made from intertwined prismarine veins, this weapon has seen countless battles, yet was never damaged.

**[!] Celestial Compass** 
*(Catacombs – final room)*
Delicate mechanism made for complex calculations.

Allows for the crossing into the outer spheres from the Apogee.

**V Decaying Space** 
*(Nameless Lands – intercosm Apogee)*
Vague shadows of regular world exist here, in this suffocating abyss. They are the only guidance one could hope for to reach the other side.

**V Frozen Twig** 
*(Nameless Lands – scholars’ fireplace)**
Although these lands are dead and barren, it was here that headmaster Auberon stumbled upon an epiphany:

“We must seek older fires, and for that we must dig deeper.”

**V Ashes** 
*(Nameless Lands –cell from western tower)*
They say that an old prophet was stuck here, in this frigid desert. Poor bastard kept staring at the sky, and tore his eyes out, when it finally stared back.

**[Trinket] Eye of the Allseer** 
*(Nameless Lands) 9*
See living creatures through any obstacle.

I have seen the endless ruins

In His Eyes I gazed and His Eyes have burned Me to ash.

From the Outside I gazed and Inside I went.

In My Eyes I gazed and My Eyes have burned Me to ash.

**V [!] Celestial Compass**
*(Nameless Lands)*
Delicate mechanism which suffered a harsh fate. Despite being in horrible condition, it should still allow for a safe return back.

**V Petrified Flesh** 
*(Befouled Valley)*
Born of this Earth or no, things of flesh will always stay of flesh. In its blind glutton, it grows and consumes everything around it. Is it perhaps a blessing, that it is doomed from the very start? 

**Infested Animal’s Hide** 
*(Befouled Valley)*
Rock-hard piece of hide of an animal, which suffered a sad fate. Infested animals’ skin hardens and becomes a solid shell, protecting them from projectiles with stunning efficiency.

**Barren Map**
*(Citadel – right after the valley)*
The sea behind Ghedagot has no bounds. It is vast and sterile, with no semblance of even the most primitive life left. No man should waste their time wandering off into that sickly blue desert.

**[E] Sedative** 
*(Citadel) – using unluck Amp11*
Puts one at peace for a short period of time.

Those admitted to the Citadel were of especially resilient minds, but their work still required them to make use of this liquid medicine, to calm their nerves.

**Golden Oak Leaves** 
*(citadel – the Golden Garden)*
Golden oaks got their name for both their brilliant leaves and the miraculous apple-like fruits they bore. Scholars were very careful with them, for they never gave any saplings.

**Depiction of a Golden Oak**
*(citadel – near golden garden)*
Long ago, a nameless traveller reached Ghedagot, with the fabulous acorns in his pouch.  The treasure was kept safely, and the traveller took his rest near the settlement.

**[Trinket] Blightworm Larvae** 
*(Citadel)*
Grants immunity to Wither.

The last descendant of once terrifying blightworms. The way that it writhes and wiggles suggests that it is hungry. 

**[Trinket] Antidote Pellets** 
*(Citadel)*
Grants immunity to Poison.

Pose great threat to those reckless, for inside these pellets is a deadly poison. But, if handled with proper care, they will greatly boost one’s resistance to all kinds of toxins. 

**[Trinket] Crimson Flask** 
*(Citadel)*
Grants immunity to Weakness and Slowness.

Humans have great resilience to this liquid that distantly resembles blood plasma. In lower beings, however, it precipitates intense and uncontrollable tissue growth.

**[Trinket] Cosmic Blossom** 
*(Citadel)*
Grants immunity to all weak negative status effects.

Only weak blightworm larvae are capable of evolving into such beautiful flowers. Its radiant aura engulfs the holder, protecting them against all non-physical harm.

**Notes on Unfading Fire** 
*(citadel - archives)*
?

**Notes on Prismarine** 
*(citadel - archives)*
A link between cosmos and prismarine was never fully understood. Almost sentient, yet still but a heap of rocks, it reeks of cosmos like no other thing.

**Refined Prismarine** 
*(citadel - halls)*
Prismarine is nigh impossible to refine. Yet, if one manages to achieve the heat akin to the great stars above, this cosmic material finally gives in.

**Notes on Citadel** 
*(Citadel - archives)*
Citadel never got a grandiose name, for it made little to no tales. And those who knew about it never cared to waste their time on such meaningless decoration. 

**Candlemaker’s Key** 
*(Citadel – archives?)*
Opens Candlemaker’s workshop. Candlemaker Yoght was uncanny, and developed an obsession with blightworms. Others didn’t understand him, but Yoght knew there was more to the elder creatures than meets the eye.

**Wedding Gift** 
*(Citadel)*
Belonged to one of Auberon’s pupils. Headmaster himself never had a wife and strongly disliked such bonds, for he knew they would dull one’s mind and lead it astray.

**Cold Embers** 
*(Auberon’s Domain)\**
Scholars of the Citadel were fascinated with the unfading fires they brought from the dark abysses. All of them were fuelled by things distantly resembling coal, with one difference – they whispered.

**Burial Torch** 
*(citadel)*
Unfading fires painted vast vistas of things long gone, and beckoned to them all those who were willing to listen.

**Scrambled Writings** 
*(Auberon’s domain – highest point)*
Scholars of the Citadel dove into the blackest depths. Upon seeing the interminable vistas of dust, they lost what little hope they had left, for they now knew exactly what awaited them. 

**Eye of a Madman**
*(Auberon’s Domain)*
The time is right. From the highest tower of the Citadel, raise your gaze toward the blazing cosmic blackness and witness the impending doom with your very own eyes!

**Decaying Space**
*(Antechamber)*
Upon making a crossing, there is naught to see but endless, suffocating blackness. One dares not disturb the gaping abyss beyond Citadel’s rotting carcass, for else they will meet a truly horrible fate.

**Transient Object**
*(Antechamber)*
As dunes arose, the Citadel persevered. Although any semblance of life has long perished from its intricate carcass, its walls remained untouched. And at last, it witnessed the new sun and seas.

***

**[!] Entropic Flame**
*(Completed Apogee)*
Allows one to delve deeper into the abyss, past its cumbersome aperture.

The flame is exquisite. Born of the perished and the decayed, it remembers things from eons infinitely distant. And it beckons you to then, finally.

**Dust**
*(Titanic City of Spires)*
Even the toughest stone withers, even the greatest kingdoms rot into nothingness. After infinite eons, even air decays, leaving behind only this blank, featureless dust.

**Towerblade**
*(Titanic City of Spires)*
Belonged to the city’s guard. Obviously, it cannot be called a sword, for it is far too thick and heavy.

**Ashes**
*(Slaves’ Last Settlement)*
The Great Lord’s numerous slaves have been becoming burdensome. In dire need of building supplies for his cathedral, and eager to bring the slaves to more manageable numbers, he has found a way to solve both problems at once.

**Ashen Bricks**
*(Slaves’ Last Settlement)*
Blood, bones and tears – all went into the foundation of this great cathedral. Cyclopean and abhorrent, it was destined to stand amidst the pyres until the end of times.

**...**
*(Great Lord’s Cathedral)*
Lord’s men rebelled against his tyrannic rule. The arrogant Lord was raised on a pyre in the cathedral of his own making. At last, he howled along with the walls and floors, pleading for the merciful time to finally crush this curse-ridden place into dust.

**Arrogant Man’s Remains** 
*(Slaves’ Last Settlement)*
Great Lord saw fate, and it instilled unthinkable horror in his mind. Blinded by his faith, he believed a great cathedral would save him from the inevitable collapse into dust.

**Golden Oak Roots**
*(Corroded Garden)*
A freakish, abhorrent mutation that defies the will of nature. Born under celestial radiation, these parasites persevere through the interminable dunes, appearing in worlds already ruined and crushed, and worlds to come.

**Starlit Gems**
*(Unyielding Forest)*
Prismarine is an omen, born from cosmic planes beyond our reach. A warning of inevitable and impending fate that shall sweep the lands clean, leaving behind only unremarkable dunes.

**...** 
*(Colluseum of the Sun God)*
But what is further, below the endless ruins, bent, broken and turned to dust? What lies even deeper than the deepest tombs of men’s ancestry?

**Old Embers**
*(Basal Womb)*
It still flickers faintly, remembering its lost radiance. But its time has long passed, and it surely won’t yield anything of worth anymore. 

This must be the only natural path, in the end...?

***

**White-stained Fuel**
It whispers of a boundless sea and fearless sailors, diving into the deep unknown. After centuries, the sea withered away, leaving behind the shores of dust.

**Orange-stained Fuel**
It whispers of a wondrous city, with titanic towers and mighty spires as far as eye can see. Streets clean, aside from unremarkable specks of dust.

**Magenta-stained Fuel**
It whispers of lowly men and women, forced into a life of slavery. Lord saw them and their ugly settlements as nothing more than fuel for his great ambitions.

**Yellow-stained Fuel**
It whispers of the sunlit coliseum, filled with clang of steel and crowd’s roars. In the end, the same steel broke its mighty walls and titanic columns.

**Lime-stained Fuel**
It whispers of vast unending tunnels under the majestic city, sprawling ever downwards into the depths of earth. The deeper one dives, the more walls start to resemble sand.

**Pink-stained Fuel**
It whispers of a kingdom, whose walls were so tall they blocked out the sun. But what would live longer, the sun or the kingdom?

**Gray-stained Fuel**
It whispers of deep jungles that were a home to the titanic poisonous worms. After the tropics withered, the worms persevered, capable of finding nutrients even in dust.

**Light Gray-stained Fuel**
It whispers of a lonely frightened vagabond. Cursed to walk the earth forever, they witnessed how it all turned to dust. The poor thing soon lost its mind.

**Cyan-stained Fuel**
It whispers of a frigid desert, where a lonely man made a communion with the sky. Before diving into the blackness, he left his sky-stained eyes, for they were no longer needed.

**Purple-stained Fuel**
It whispers of great heaps of flesh, multiplying and swarming in the deep chasms. Their hunger was insatiable, and so they spread endlessly, until they finally withered.

**Blue-stained Fuel**
It whispers of an arrogant lord, who built the great cathedral from the ashes of his people. Little did he know, a pyre would soon be raised for him as well.

**Brown-stained Fuel**
It whispers of men, who built the aeonian citadel, destined to outlive time itself. Even in face of inescapable destiny, they had a sliver of hope.

**Green-stained Fuel**
It whispers of miraculous golden gardens. Grown under the loving stars and heavenly earth, its descendants live on, even after their home crumbled away.

**Red-stained Fuel**
It whispers of a great citadel, found by the lucky few. Though it appears untouched by time, its carcass has long ago crumbled to dust.

**Vision of Dust (black fuel)**
It whispers of an all-embracing, all-loving Mother, the great boundless plains of unremarkable dust. All comes from it, and all will return to it, in time.

# Technical notes
## Warping around the map
Use `/scoreboard players set [NAME] warp [VALUE]`. [VALUE] can be: 
   - `-1` - spawn chunks & redstone.
   - `1` - Old Sea (first ship)
   - `2` - Northern Watchtower (white wool)
   - `3` - Mouth of Geheel (orange wool)
   - `4` - The Apogee (monument)
   - `5` - Ghedagot (basically intersection 3)
   - `6` - The Citadel (basically intersection 4)
   - `7` - Geheel's Branch (area before monument)
   - `8` - Befouled Valley (area before Citadel)
   - `100` - Nameless Lands (cyan area entrance)
   - `101` - Cyan area exit below the monument. DO NOT WARP HERE, it triggers breaking the floor in the monument.
   - `777` - Black area (does not warp player anywhere currently, only shows the title and blacks everything out)

To use warps 1-8 you have to be near a warp point in the map OR in the spawn chunks. Because of that you will usually need to do a 'warp -1' follow by 'warp wherever' to get to wherever from any point of the map.
Warp 100 can only be used in the pit under the monument. Warp 101 can only be used at the end of Cyan area.

TP coords to things unavailable via warp:
- `-2813 247 181` - Antechamber (red area)
- `-2486 95 1687` - Titanic City of Spires (black area 1)
- `-1822 88 1409` - Slaves' Settlement & Cathedral of the Great Lord (black area 2)

Time sets for custom skyboxes:
  - `13025` - Old Sea (From the very start to Light Blue area)
  - `13045` - Apogee (Light Blue -> Ghedagot)
  - `13075` - Ghedagot sandstorm (Ghedagot -> the Citadel)
  - `13100` - Nameless lands white (Cyan area only)
  - `13500+` - citadel (Citadel and onwards)
NOTE: Mobs will not spawn under skylight in 13025-13100 timeset range! This means that all spawners placed under skylight before the Citadel MUST BE CUSTOM MADE to be able to spawn in skylight.
This shouldn't concern you since I have placed loot and mobs up to the Citadel, but be aware nonetheless.

# Discarded Lore items
## Books
**[“On our purpose”][Auberon]**
Alpha. Beginning. The origin of Life. Men endlessly seek answers to such grandiose mysteries, and will continue to for centuries to come. Are we children of gods, or merely an insignificant speck of dust, puny pebbles of consciousness near the Great Citadel of Existence? I have been searching for the answer for decades, but every time I was getting closer and closer, the truth always slipped out of my reach. But now, oh now I’d give up everything for a mere chance to forget the ineffable things I know. 

**[Auberon]** 
We were a rather joyous bunch back then. Insatiably addicted to life in all of its lust and gluttony. Full of hope in our pursuit of knowledge. The research of our Beginning, we thought, was truly a magnificent cause. May we find the answers, surely a never-ending glory would follow.

**[“On the symmetry”][Auberon]** 
Our research went well, we were making steady progress. But there were always these… traces. Even when we thought we were finally getting closer to a proper theory, something just didn’t add up. There was this faint presence of some utterly primal, alien symmetry. It hinted us that there were still secrets left to be uncovered. And thus we delved deeper and deeper into something that could not quite be called science anymore.

**[“On the Infinite Cosmic Sea”][Auberon]** 
And there I found it. Gazing at the infinite blackness of night sky in my domain, I at once found myself at the edge, looking far below into the boundless Sea of blackness. I knew immediately it was the missing piece, for it was both laughably simple and incomprehensibly complex at once. That alien, primal symmetry that eluded us so many times, now was ruthlessly invading my brain, reconstructing my very mind in ways words fail to describe. 

I was standing in the halls of Creator, the great forge of Existence. Or was it the Creator himself? Or was I the Creator?

I came back with Knowledge, and led those most devoted to our reason to it as well. It was time to ditch our nugatory wandering in search of Truth. It was time to make it ourselves.
 
**[“On the Architect”]** 
When I first saw it, it was just pure blackness. But the longer I gazed, the more I started to see.  The marvellous symmetries of scales infinitely bigger than anything regular world could ever yield. The mechanisms and constructs of properties vastly beyond my comprehension. The more I saw, the stronger my desire to plunge into it became. Others were cautious of this place, but they just didn’t see enough yet.

**[Auberon]** 
Not yet completely free of my petty humanness, I began my exploration of the Sea cautiously. My naïve try to descend via a rope ladder amounted to nothing, for no matter how deep down I went, I felt not an inch closer to the great constructs I saw far below. Only way I’d ever reach them would be to plunge myself in there with no safe way to turn back. And so I switched to dropping material things into the Sea. Objects such as pebbles and books vanished into nothingness, with not a single trace of their existence left. But, it was different with things of organic nature, and, in particular, those alive. Those came back.

**[“On malformations”]**
Most of the animal subjects came back as incoherent piles of flesh and organic matter. Several species, however, still bore semblance to ordinary life, albeit horribly malformed. Pigs, for example, turned into grotesque rotting humanoids of a potent muscular definition. Fascinatingly for us all, they seemed to have developed a hive-like intellect: Upon hurting a single subject, every single one nearby was suddenly enraged. They were, in the end, discarded, for, albeit amusing in a twisted way, we needed not such abominations.

**[“On cows”]** 
The most useful ones were cows. Their malformed brethren have shown absolute and utter lack of any semblance of intelligence, perhaps because vast portions of their bodies were made not of flesh, but rather of some unknown kind of fungus. What made them useful was the fact that, instead of milk, these organisms produced fluid of a highly nutritious kind, good enough to sustain a human.

**[“On waste”]** 
Simplest product of our research is flesh. Alien, flawless flesh made my throwing organisms such as animals into the Cosmic Sea. Its qualities are fascinating: decay does not touch it, instead it slowly petrifies into red rocky substance, which upon ignition burns for days and even weeks. It quickly becomes a nuisance to our work, however, as we’re unable to rid ourselves of it quickly. 

**[“On majestic flames”]**
We went further. Next step was, surely, the only logical one, albeit certainly lacking any semblance of humanity. But it was for a greater cause, of course. 

What came back from the Sea was truly marvellous. Not just a limp pile of flesh and bones. Rather, the elegant form of a truly perfect nature, giving birth to a fantastic undying flame. And the smell, ever so fleeting yet somehow bringing forth ideas of ubiquity. All beasts and malformations we’ve gathered so far were absolutely terrified of this glorious thing, for it ultimately was the manifestation of the one thing they ultimately lacked.

**[“On the key”]**
I finally found it, the key to the great Cosmic Sea, the architect of existence! It’s Truth, no more no less. Mere men lack such boundless knowledge, yet enough majestic flames produced from brightest of minds will certainly allow at least some contact. 

## Other items
**?**
*(Northern Watchtower)*
Even now, Beacons still cinder, protecting the outside world.
One could say, that their flickering embers are almost alive.

**Old Maps**
*(Mouth of Geheel)*
Utter remoteness and treacherous terrain ensured, 
that Ghedagot remained the first and the last city 
here, at the end of the world.

**Prismarine Shard**
*(Dig Site)* 
Considered the most valuable material by those knowledgeable. 
To an outsider, however, they seem merely pretty rocks.

**Prismarine Pebbles**
*(Dig Site)*
This dig site fascinated scholars extremely, for 
prismarine cannot be found naturally. 

**Research Notes**
*(Apogee)*
The Apogee was constructed as a means to make the crossing 
to the outer voids. Later, it was refashioned by Master Auberon 
to allow crossings of the opposite nature. 

**Pebble**
*(near gates in Lordvale)*
In their pitiful flight, citizens of Ghedagot sealed the city gate off.
Small entrances, like the one near the aqueduct, are still open, however.

**some flower**
*(Garden of Hanging Stars)* 
This garden was known and visited by scholars commonly in 
their early days. As their research went on, however, only 
some ventured here to at least somehow ease their minds.

**Books on architecture**
*(Intersection 3)* 
Walls of the city are barren and hold nothing of interest.

**Malformed Pig Eye**
*(Somewhere in Ghedagot?)*
There are some truths that men are not meant to know. By delving
into the dark corners of existence, Master Auberon and the scholars
brought certain and inexorable doom upon this land.

**Burnt Petrified Flesh**
*(Protocitadel - dungeons)*
The only reliable way to get into the Citadel is through the dungeon-like corridors below it - an addition by the scholars to dispose of copious amounts of waste. 
 
**Distorted Skull**
*(Protocitadel – one of the bloody rooms?)*
Alien in its curves, albeit still suggestive of structure similar to humans. When scholars first came, Citadel was littered with such corpses, yet their origin remained a mystery.

**Chronicles of the Old Times**
*(Protocitadel – archives?)*
Long ago, young scholar reached this citadel at the edge of the world and made great use of it. But in the end, he never made one final step, despite knowing clearly what it was. Perhaps you will be wiser?

**Unreadable Calculations**
*(Protocitadel - archives)*
The archives were kept in greatest condition, for preservation of knowledge was sacred. Used mainly for obscure studies and calculations, it possesses numerous work tables. Walking on them is obviously absolutely uncivilized, many would even say barbaric.

**Refined Prismarine**
*(Great Errant Halls)*
Most earthly materials pale in comparison to this carefully purified gift of cosmos. It’s a pity that only a small amount remains in the upper refinery of the Citadel. 

**Petrified Flesh**
*(Citadel – Leviath’s tower)*
After returned flesh started sporadically growing, infesting the sandy valley, it became clear that abandonment of Ghedagot was inevitable.

**Celestial Rocks**
*(Auberon’s Domain)*
The main function of the Citadel –to make the crossing into the inner spheres - manifests itself in its highest tower. Master Auberon’s stern will and diligence ensured he made full use of it.

**?**
*(?)*
Crossing out to the outer planes is relatively easy, for they are intrinsically built upon our rules. It is the crossing into the inner ones that is extremely troublesome.

**Abyssal Slag**
*(Domain of the Abyss)*
Complex matter is temporary, and the deeper you delve into the inner planes, the less of it is required. Thusly, everything that does not belong slowly turns into this black rock, devoid of any qualities.

**?**
*(Distant Bastille)*
In these lands devoid of life and death, Master Auberon had an epiphany: 
“It is not the outer spheres we must seek, but the inner ones”.

**Malformed Rib**
*(A Distant Bastille – start of the bastille)*
Long ago, a certain prophet was imprisoned here. He spent the rest of his days gazing at the Sky from his cell. And the Sky gazed back.
 
**?**
*(?)*
Only a highly organised, almost omnipotent mind can endure 
the crossing into the innermost spheres and touch the Truth. 
Together, the scholars possessed such quality, and Master Auberon knew that well.

**X Beacon Fuel**
Somehow it makes you feel like you’re not alone.

**X Beacon Fuel Tag**
It reads:  *Y*

# Discarded first concept of the Infinite Cosmic Voids

Infinite Cosmic Voids: This is the ultimate culmination of player’s journey. It can only be access after there is nothing more to be done by the player on the outside world. Just as the world is split into a bunch of different parts, Infinite Cosmic Voids will be split into 5 parts, echoing the whole map in twisted, gothic and ruined castle-like aesthetics. No loot there, and the player doesn’t lose his things upon death(?). All loot needed coms as natural parts of the terrain or as mob drops.

## Part 1: The Sea
...

## Part 2: The Land
The Land is technically ‘above’ the Sea, and it starts as a continuation of Sea’s giant column. Only now, it feels much more open and the columns end at the top, as if holding up the black sky. Player ascends upwards, going from one column to another via humongous archways, and eventually gets to the staircase, that leads him to the City. 

## Part 3: The City
Ascending the staircase, player finds himself amongst a giant amalgamation of arches, spires and towers, All enclosed with rather chaotic gigantic walls. He goes through this semi-horizontal mess, which ends in a cathedral-ish fractal gothic structure which is higher than all of the others and a bit secluded. To the left of it, in the lowest part of the area, are some swamp-like things all overgrown with eyes. To the right are the halls and passageways the player will take to get to the Cathedral in the first place. In the cathedral, player gets to the highest tower and then ascends into the Citadel.

## Part 4: The Citadel
The Citadel is the last part of Infinite Cosmic Voids, and the only one completely open to the sky. Player exits the Cathedral’s highest tower to a rocky perimeter of the Citadel, with Citadel’s façade invisible. Player then has to go around the building and, in the end, climb it even higher. It culminates with player climbing one last, not-too-broken tower. At its apogee, he finds the black wool silently spinning in place. Upon touching it, player’s inventory gets wiped and replaced with just black wools. At this point, the player kills everything around it automatically. They then come back to the void-apogee place, which is where they can get back into the regular world.

## Part 5: The Apogee
This is the final area of the map, with nowhere else to go from there. Looks like a malformed Apogee, with perhaps numerous chaotic gothic structures enclosing it from all sides. This is the only place in the map where background music plays. Player is free to wander around for a little bit, after which they are supposed to the Apogee Monument and place the black wool onto its proper spot. At that point everything begins to turn to black bedrock, leaving the player in complete darkness but with a single fire burning at the center of it all, where the monument was. The End.
